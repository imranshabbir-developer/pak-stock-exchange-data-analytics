Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX): Data Analytics Tasks 
As Data Analysts, you are now responsible for understanding and interpreting real financial market data from 
the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). PSX is Pakistan’s central marketplace where investors buy and sell 
shares, indices, bonds, and other securities. Every trading day generates valuable datasets that analysts use to 
study market behavior, identify trends, evaluate risks, and support investment decisions. 
To complete the 60 analytics tasks assigned to you, you will work with several key types of PSX data: 
 Price Data (OHLC): 
Daily Open, High, Low, and Close values, used for trend analysis, moving averages, volatility, and 
forecasting. 
 Volume & Turnover: 
Shows trading activity and liquidity across stocks, helping you understand where market interest is 
increasing or declining. 
 Market Indices (KSE-100, KSE-30, All-Share Index): 
Used for benchmarking performance, calculating Beta, understanding market movements, and 
comparing stocks with overall market trends. 
 Sector Data: 
Companies grouped into sectors like Banking, Cement, Technology, Oil & Gas—important for sector
wise comparisons and portfolio diversification. 
 Corporate Actions & Financial Indicators: 
Dividends, earnings, bonus shares, rights issues, and annual reports—used in event analysis and 
performance evaluation. 
 Economic & External Influencers: 
USD/PKR exchange rate, interest rates, inflation, global market shifts—critical when studying how 
macro factors impact the PSX. 
Throughout these tasks, you will apply the full data analytics workflow: 
✔ Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing 
✔ Exploratory and statistical analysis 
✔ Technical indicators and charting 
✔ Machine learning and forecasting 
✔ Portfolio analytics and backtesting 
✔ Event-based and economic impact studies 
✔ Automated reporting and dashboard design 
By completing these tasks, you will learn how real analysts examine market data, extract insights, and support 
decision-making in the finance and investment world. These activities simulate how actual Data Analysts work 
in investment firms, trading desks, fintech companies, and research departments.
